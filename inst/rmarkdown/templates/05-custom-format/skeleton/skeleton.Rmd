# About

You will notice in the YAML above that a custom output format has been specified: `MyTemplates::my_html_format`. This makes it easy to customize output formats to use specific options or refer to external files. Readers should refer to [Chapter 18](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/new-formats.html) for a detailed description, but the key benefits of creating your own format is that:

- You can configure the options of R markdown to use your own settings. For example, you may always want to display a table of contents or have a favourite theme which you want all documents to use.
- It allows you to refer to external template files without having to have them in the same directory as the R Markdown document. This makes the template much more flexible.

# External Files

This template includes several custom files:

- A custom HTML footer, which is stored in `inst/rmarkdown/resources/footer.html`.
- A custom HTML header, which is stored in `inst/rmarkdown/resources/header.html`. This adds a logo to the header of the document.
- A custom styles file `inst/rmarkdown/resources/styles.css`, which alters the appearance of tables.

# Analysis

The custom CSS file has been used to change the style of the document. Here is an example table:

```{r table}
knitr::kable(mtcars[1:5, 1:5], caption = "An example table")
```

# Customisation

As some ideas for using this template, you may wish to customise your own document:

- Change the default options used in the `my_html_format` function. For example, it will use the theme "lumen", but this could be changed to "yeti", "sandstone" etc.
- Update the footer file to include your own name and email address, and edit the urls for the social media icons so that they they link to your account.
- Add your own logo by altering the `header.html` file. You will notice that the URL is referenced as a URL: this is recommended as it makes your package more portable.
